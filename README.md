| Deity | Department | Essence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Digital Weaver** | Computer Science | Binary tides, data currents |
| **The Storm Warden** | Electrical & Electronics | Lightning strikes, power surges |
| **The Abyss Forged** | Mechanical | Pressure depths, iron will |
| **The Reef Alchemist** | Chemical | Coral transmutation, elemental flux |
